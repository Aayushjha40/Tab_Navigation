# Tab Navigation in Flutter

## Description
This Flutter project demonstrates how to implement a simple tab navigation system using `DefaultTabController`. It includes a `TabBar` with 3 tabs, each displaying different content. This is a common pattern for navigating between different sections of an app.

## Features
- **TabBar with 3 tabs**: The app contains a tab bar with three separate tabs.
- **Different Content for Each Tab**: Each tab displays unique content.
- **DefaultTabController**: Uses `DefaultTabController` to manage the state and switching between tabs.

## How It Works
1. **TabBar**: A `TabBar` widget is used to define the tabs and their labels.
2. **Tab Views**: Each tab displays different content, managed by a `TabBarView` widget.
3. **DefaultTabController**: The `DefaultTabController` is used to handle the state of the selected tab and the display of corresponding content.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: Framework for building natively compiled applications.
- **Dart**: Programming language used to build the app.
